        <h3>Voice controlled Wikipedia Searcher (Name not final):</h3>
        <p>This is a project that i thought up of while browsing PYPI and seeing the Wikipedia library and Voice Recognition library. After much trouble attempting to get the voice recognition library to work, I finally was able to mess around with it and eventually develop this.</p>
        <p>It was created in Python 3.8 and can be found <a href='https://github.com/Sebby37/Voice-Controlled-Wikipedia-Searcher' target='_blank'>here</a> (https://github.com/Sebby37/Voice-Controlled-Wikipedia-Searcher)</p>
        <p>Feel free to suggest any changes as it probably isnt programmed as good as it could be.</p>
        <p>The libraries that you will need to run this are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href='https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/'>Wikipedia</a></li>
            <li><a href='https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/'>Pyttsx3</a></li>
            <li><a href='https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/'>SpeechRecognition</a></li>
            <li><a href='https://pypi.org/project/requests/'>Requests</a></li>
        </ul>
