        <h1 align='center'>Seb C:'s Cool Website - Home</h1>
        <p>Hello, welcome to my site where I will be hosting code and have other stuff.</p>
        <p>I specialize in Python, however I am still relatively inexperienced in some of the more complex parts of it. I do know html and css relatively well and know a bit of JS and a tiny bit of C#, Java and C/C++. This site was designed and written entirely by me.</p>
        <p>I don't have the best eye for design and prefer to work on the backend/code of things rather than the frontent/ui which is why the site doesn't look that good.</p>
        <p>Don't expect me to update this site much as I will most likely be busy with other life stuff or I may just forget to.</p>
